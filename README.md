# GraphicNotation
Converts images to sheet music

Finds the most common colors in an image, assigns them to a notated texture, and then generates a score for 3 parts.

Test-input images in \Images
Notation boxes which are then pieced together in \Sheetmusic
Output files (full score and parts/rows) in \Output
